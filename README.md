# Scala Capstone Project
This contains code developed during the [Scala Functional Programming Capstone project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-capstone/home/welcome).

The project contains different milestone document based on  the needed score.
#### Data extraction and processing
The data used comes from the [National Center for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/) of the United States.
The extraction and processing of temperature and station data in CSV format is done using the [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) library - due to its massive ability to analyze data using parallel computing.

#### Visualization
A library called [Scrimage](https://index.scala-lang.org/sksamuel/scrimage) is used for generating the tiles and grid of the map.

#### Interface
The [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/) front-end web tool is used for compiling the Scala code and rendering on a web interface.

    You can check through the commits to have a good idea of the development journey while targeting each milestone.
